              <h2>Intro</h2>
              <p>
                As part of the Memorisely 2024's UX/UI Design cohort, our first
                case-study to solve revolved around building an non-existent
                feature for the AirBnb travel app. Specifically at the time,
                AirBnb had no way to split group payments across their iOS
                mobile app when using it for bookings. This lead to
                inconvenience as well as having to use third party payment apps
                amongst groups.

              <h2>Business Goal</h2>
              <p>
                The business goal was defined as :
                <b
                  >"Our goal is to enhance the user experience of booking
                  accommodation as a group. Currently, only individuals can book
                  accommodation and encourage their friends or colleagues to pay
                  them back after payment is made. We'd like to make it easier
                  for groups of people to split the cost of an Airbnb when
                  traveling together"</b

        </div>
        <div class="subSection">
          <h2>User Segment</h2>
          <p>
            The user segment we'd like to target to improve the group booking
            experience on Airbnb.com consists of travelers who plan trips
            together in larger parties, such as families, friends, and
            co-workers.
          </p>
          <p>
            These users typically require accommodations that can comfortably
            accommodate multiple guests and offer amenities suited for group
            travel, such as shared living spaces, multiple bedrooms, and
            family-friendly facilities. They often seek longer stays and may be
            interested in exploring discounts or special offers for larger
            parties.
          </p>
          <p>
            By catering to the specific needs of this segment, we aim to enhance
            their booking journey, increase user satisfaction, and tap into a
            relatively untapped market to drive higher revenue and gain a
            competitive advantage.

        <div class="subSection">
          <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
          <p>
            By understanding the business need we defined our problem statement
            as :
            <b>
              Traveling professionals need an enhanced cost-splitting feature
              and improved communication because they desire a more
              user-friendly and integrated experience. However, the current
              experience involves challenges in cost-splitting, communication
              and inclusiveness during the booking process leading to user
              frustration and inconvenience</b

          <h1>Solution</h1>
          <p>
            This was a great example of a real world opportunity that allowed me
            to build a solution for an existing experience with abundant user
            traffic. Things that came to mind upon initial brainstorming
            sessions where :
            <b
              >user profile tagging, customizable payment splits, group chats
              and payment tracking and reminders.</b
            >
            Based on the Qualitative research data we gathered from our survey
            results. We decided to implement a solution that was based directly
            on a user pain points. As a formal plan in order to implement the
            design, the process became the following:

          <h2>Qualitative Research</h2>
          <p>
            In order to get a good understanding of user pain points and needs,
            we started off with Qualitative user interviews which was created
            via
            <b>Google forms</b> and sent to 14 experienced travelers. We asked
            questions surrounding their general frustrations as well as
            preferred payment splitting methods.
          </p>
          <p>
            Following this, we made sure to synthesize these results via
            <b>Dovetail</b>. This allowed us to organize it and advance our
            design approach by creating an Affinity Map.

          <p>
            While mapping out the existing content of AirBnb, we realized we had
            to alter the structure to include another path users could take. The
            best place to add this was within the individual listing page. Here
            the users have the option to add other users before being prompted
            to make their payment or continue as usual to the bookings page.

            interactive parts without getting bogged down in visual design
            details. This was the phase that showed us how our feature was going
            to become a reality. By focusing on the skeletal framework of the

            By understanding the brand's defined visual identity, including
            colors, typography, and any other design elements that reflect
            AirBnB's personality; the next task was to create a color and font
            style library in order to reuse them for consistency when building

          <h2>UI Components</h2>
          <p>
            By creating reusable UI components in Figma such as buttons, icons,
            and navigation bars, we maintained visual coherence, streamlined
            updates, and accelerated the development. This ensures a cohesive
            and user-friendly experience while saving time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Understanding auto-layout and component variants in Figma is crucial
            for efficient and consistency. Auto-layout enables dynamic resizing
            and alignment of UI elements, ensuring adaptability across different
            screen sizes and content lengths.
          </p>
          <p>
            Component variants allow for the creation of reusable elements with
            multiple states/variations which facilitates quick iteration. Usage
            of these features streamlines the design process and promotes
            scalability.

              UI iterations allow us to refine and improve the UI based on
              feedback and testing. By iterating on ideas, we addressed and
              identified usability issues around the behavior of the slider

            <p>
              We originally had it go from point A to point B seamlessly.
              However, we came to understand that users would need to stop at a
              certain percentage and thus this change was made to accommodate
              for this. We included several variants as a part of this component
              to allow the user to do just that. This was the first version
              which was later changed.

              The High-Fidelity Prototype is one of the more exciting parts of
              the overall design process. It provided a realistic representation
              of the final product, allowing us to visualize and interact with
              the design as if it were developed. This enables thorough testing,
              validation of design decisions, and effective communication of the
              user experience, leading to more informed iterations and
              ultimately, a better final product. Below are highlights of the

                Based on my initial understanding of Figma's limitation when
                working with sliders, the smoothness of the scroll can only be
                present if it is built in such a way where the user wouldn't
                need to stop at a certain percentage.
                <b
                  >This was a great example of a developer handoff note allowing
                  them to keep in mind the prototype's difference from the real
                  world use-case and how the participant identified this.</b
                >
              </li>
              <li>
                <b
                  >“Do other guests have control over the percentage split ?”</b
                >
                This was a great insight from a participant. Ideally a future
                iteration of this would be to add a success screen/waiting
                screen letting the user know, of the other guests approval for
                the split before being able to finalize their payment.

          For the implementation phase, we understood the need to document the
          design assets. Making sure to include detailed specifications and
          annotated wireframes, as well as pixel-perfect mockups along with
          updated CSS. Below are some highlighted notes that we would ensure to
          communicate to the developers:

            <li>
              <b> Payment Splitting Logic:</b> We determined that the total cost
              is by default divided evenly amongst travelers within a group.
              This default amount would change depending on how many people are
              included.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>UI Components:</b> Specifications for our UI components
              include, smooth scroll animation for the slider, reset button
              which sets back the percentages to an even amount and user profile
              components with outlined CSS
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Error Handling and Validation:</b> Some of the things that came
              to mind with error states include, outlining validation rules for
              scenarios like insufficient funds, incomplete payment information,
              or attempts to split costs unevenly without consensus. Further, as
              designers we understood how defining these errors should be
              communicated to users via the dev phase.

          This project highlighted the significance of collaboration and
          communication within a design team, as well as the importance of
          receiving and incorporating constructive feedback. Building the
          feature reinforced the importance of attention to detail in UI design,
          such as typography, color schemes, and iconography, to create a
          visually appealing and cohesive UI while keeping in mind the brand
          identity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, this case-study provided me with hands-on experience in the
          entire design process, from ideation to execution, and highlighted the
          importance of empathy, iteration, and collaboration.
