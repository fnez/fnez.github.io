              <p>
                As part of the Memorisely 2024's UX/UI Design cohort, our second
                case-study to solve was to enhance the content creator
                discoverability within Patreon's desktop app.

                The business goal was defined as :

                  creatives on Patreon, thereby increasing patron engagement and
                  support for a wider range of creators. This improvement should
                  lead to increased patronage, higher creator satisfaction, and
                  overall growth in the platform's user base and revenue."</b

            <b>
              Currently, content creators on Patreon especially emerging and
              niches, struggle with discoverability on the platform. This
              challenge hinders their ability to grow their patron base and
              achieve financial stability. On the other hand, patrons often find
              it difficult to discover new and diverse creators that align with
              their interests, which can lead to decreased engagement and
              support.</b

                    barriers to supporting creators on such platforms. This

            As outlined previously, our first step was to conduct User
            Interviews. After conducting 6 interviews, we synthesized the data
            and categorized them within 3 trends/patterns in order to guide our
            design:

                <b>Quality:</b>Interviewees prioritize content quality and
                credibility when choosing to support creators. Furthermore,
                direct recommendations or referrals from creators influence
                their support decisions on platforms like Patreon.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Social media variety:</b> Other social media platforms like

                purchasing merchandise.

                challenges in discovering new creators, indicating a potential
                gap in content discovery methods or platforms.

            focused on enhancing the discoverability of content creators,
            understanding both direct and indirect competitors provides valuable

            <p>
              The feature for the Patreon app culminated in a user-centric
              solution that effectively addresses key challenges. By thoroughly
              understanding user needs and pain points, we developed intuitive
              navigation, recommendations, and improved content categorization
              from within the landing page to the individual creator's page.

          <p>
            A big learning of course is the usability testing portion. When
            conducting user interviews for the usability part we learned more
            about what iterations we could be implemented while moving forward.
            This would also lead to improvements by creating user experiements
            via A/B Testing.

        <p>
          Through extensive user research and iterative design, we implemented
          intuitive navigation, enhanced search capabilities, and
          recommendations. These improvements facilitate easier discovery of new
          and niche creators, increasing patron engagement and support. The
          final design effectively meets the needs of both creators and patrons,
          promoting higher satisfaction and contributing to the overall growth
          and success of the Patreon platform.

          I was incredibly proud I got the opportunity to work on this case
          study. It was a rewarding experience that allowed me to dive into
          unique challenges that both creators and followers may face. Working
          on it felt like a meaningful cause as it aligned with my passion for
          creating user-centered designs.
